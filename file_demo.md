**{{page.Mercury}}** is the smallest planet in the **Solar System** and the closest to the **{{page.Sun}}**. Its orbit around the **{{page.Sun}}** takes 87.97 **Earth** days, the shortest of all the **{{page.Sun}}**'s planets. It is named after the Roman god Mercurius (**{{page.Mercury}}**), god of commerce, messenger of the gods, and mediator between gods and mortals, corresponding to the Greek god Hermes (Ἑρμῆς). Like **Venus**, **{{page.Mercury}}** orbits the **{{page.Sun}}** within **Earth**'s orbit as an inferior planet, and its apparent distance from the **{{page.Sun}}** as viewed from **Earth** never exceeds 28°. This proximity to the **{{page.Sun}}** means the planet can only be seen near the western horizon after **{{page.Sun}}**set or the eastern horizon before **{{page.Sun}}**rise, usually in twilight. At this time, it may appear as a bright star-like object, but is more difficult to observe than **Venus**. From **Earth**, the planet telescopically displays the complete range of phases, similar to **Venus** and the Moon, which recurs over its synodic period of approximately 116 days.

**{{page.Mercury}}** rotates in a way that is unique in the **Solar System**. It is tidally locked with the **{{page.Sun}}** in a 3:2 spin–orbit resonance,[17] meaning that relative to the fixed stars, it rotates on its axis exactly three times for every two revolutions it makes around the **{{page.Sun}}**.[a][18] As seen from the **{{page.Sun}}**, in a frame of reference that rotates with the orbital motion, it appears to rotate only once every two Mercurian years. An observer on **{{page.Mercury}}** would therefore see only one day every two Mercurian years.

**{{page.Mercury}}**'s axis has the smallest tilt of any of the **Solar System**'s planets (about 1⁄30 degree). Its orbital eccentricity is the largest of all known planets in the **Solar System**;[b] at perihelion, **{{page.Mercury}}**'s distance from the **{{page.Sun}}** is only about two-thirds (or 66%) of its distance at aphelion. **{{page.Mercury}}**'s surface appears heavily cratered and is similar in appearance to the Moon's, indicating that it has been geologically inactive for billions of years. Having almost no atmosphere to retain heat, it has surface temperatures that vary diurnally more than on any other planet in the **Solar System**, ranging from 100 K (−173 °C; −280 °F) at night to 700 K (427 °C; 800 °F) during the day across the equatorial regions.[19] The polar regions are constantly below 180 K (−93 °C; −136 °F). The planet has no known natural satellites.

Two spacecraft have visited **{{page.Mercury}}**: Mariner 10 flew by in 1974 and 1975; and MESSENGER, launched in 2004, orbited **{{page.Mercury}}** over 4,000 times in four years before exhausting its fuel and crashing into the planet's surface on April 30, 2015.[20][21][22] The BepiColombo spacecraft is planned to arrive at **{{page.Mercury}}** in 2025.

Name and symbol

The ancients knew **{{page.Mercury}}** by different names depending on whether it was an evening star or a morning star. By about 350 BC, the ancient Greeks had realized the two stars were one.[23] They knew the planet as Στίλβων Stilbōn, meaning "twinkling", and Ἑρμής Hermēs, for its fleeting motion,[24] a name that is retained in modern Greek (Ερμής Ermis).[25] The Romans named the planet after the swift-footed Roman messenger god, **{{page.Mercury}}** (Latin Mercurius), which they equated with the Greek Hermes, because it moves across the sky faster than any other planet.[23][26] The astronomical symbol for **{{page.Mercury}}** is a stylized version of Hermes' caduceus; a Christian cross was added in the 16th century: ☿.

Physical characteristics

**{{page.Mercury}}** is one of four terrestrial planets in the **Solar System**, and is a rocky body like **Earth**. It is the smallest planet in the **Solar System**, with an equatorial radius of 2,439.7 kilometres (1,516.0 mi).[3] **{{page.Mercury}}** is also smaller—albeit more massive—than the largest natural satellites in the **Solar System**, Ganymede and Titan. **{{page.Mercury}}** consists of approximately 70% metallic and 30% silicate material.
